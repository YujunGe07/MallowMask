# 🌅 MorningMallow

**A smart wake-up experience for students, professionals, and anyone in shared spaces.**

MorningMallow is a wearable smart eye mask that gently wakes you using soft light, vibration, and temperature control — no sound, no stress, and no roommates throwing pillows at you. Designed with empathy, backed by science, and built for real college living.

## 🔧 What It Does

**MorningMallow** delivers a peaceful, multi-sensory wake-up experience through:

- 🌤️ **Blue Light Simulation**: Simulates a natural sunrise to nudge your circadian rhythm
- 💓 **Temple Vibration**: Gentle low-frequency haptics to wake without noise
- 🌡️ **Thermal Control**: Subtle forehead heating and cooling for sleep transitions
- 🎵 **Sound Therapy**: Built-in speakers for sleep and wake-up audio
- 📱 **App Integration**: Control all features via a mobile app
- 🧠 **Smart Sensors**: Detect when you're waking to automate lights or blinds
- 👯‍♀️ **Roommate-Aware Mode**: Minimizes external disruptions in shared spaces
